#So this would seem like a lot for just a password generator, and it is. But I wanted to try and implement a strength
#checker. Because the generator occasionally wont put a symbol or number in it.
#So I used some regex things and made it not print out the password unless it was valid

#Getting stuff I need

syms = "~`! @#$%^&*()_-+={[}]|\:;'<,>.?/"
validchars = lcase + ucase + nums + syms
leng = 16
#While loops stops when this is true
#I wanted to style it like a do while loop, but python doesn't have those. Sad.
