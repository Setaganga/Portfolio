Hello! I hope its me or someone that I gave this to!
To operate, you will have to make your own python file and access it there.
You can rig up your own fancy system, I just give you the tools.
SGGen and SGGde are the ones you want to import to your script.
An example would look like this:

import SGGen as sge
print(sge.Encode("text that you want here"))

Hopefully it should work for you. If it doesn't? Oh well!

Have fun
