# Portfolio
Hello all, this is my coding portfolio!

Whats inside my portfolio?

  ---I have challenges for hackerrank and freecodecamp, some math calculators, some cipher working, and just some random projects that I've made.
  
  ---A lot of the programs I write are in Python, (because I use python as a primary language), but these can be reworked for other languages as well.
  
What am I qualified in?

  ---To explain what I intend here I have to explain my "ranking system".
  
  ---A: I have a proficient understanding of modules, libraries and more complex things to do with the language. It is a language which I use weekly/daily.
  
  ---B: I have a basic understanding of how to do variables, functions, operations, types, classes and objects, conditionals, and loops.
  
  ---C: Know some syntax and stuff, but not confident enough to say I know the language.
  
  
  ---Python A
  
  ---JS A
  
  
  ---Java B
  
  ---C++ B
  
  ---C# B
  
  ---HTML B
  
  ---CSS B
  
  ---PHP B
  
  
  ---C C
  
  ---SQL C
  
  
What am I doing now?

  ---I'm currently learning C, Django, and SQL. I'm taking the HarvardCS50x CS Course. I also occasionally do some challenges on Hackerrank.com, and am learning using freecodecamp, w3schools, and hackerrank.
  
What do I plan to do later on?

  ---Next year I will be taking CS and Intro to Programming in school. 
  
  ---I hope to be certified in "Scientific Computing in Python" and "Back End Development" on freecodecamp. 
  
  ---I plan to go to the Colorado School of Mines majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics.
