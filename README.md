# Portfolio
This is my code portfolio. I have challenges for hackerrank and freecodecamp, some math calculators, some cipher working, and just some random projects that I've made

I've done the w3schools courses for JS and Python, with uncompleted but still good levels of understanding with other languages such as the entire C family, Java, HTML and CSS, and PHP

I'm currently taking the CS50X Harvard Course, doing some challenges on Hackerrank.com, and hoping to be certified in "Scientific Computing in Python" and "Back End Development" on freecodecamp.org

Next year I will also be taking Computer Science and Intro to Programming, and later on I will take AP Computer Science
