So I learned a lot about Java.

Java is a strange language.
It's a compiled language and it is statically typed.
Polar opposites of Python.
I also found out Java is a pain in the Assembly SQL SQL to compile when working with packages

I learned a lot about Packages, Directories, Compiling, and Java Syntax
from just these 2 files.

Is Java still a powerful language? Yes.
Do I want to use it in the future? Probably not.
