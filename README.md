# Portfolio
Hello all, this is my coding portfolio!

What's inside my portfolio?

  ---I have challenges for hackerrank and freecodecamp, some random cipher and math programs, some random projects, and some of the C work for CS50x
  
  ---A lot of the programs I write are in Python, (because I use python as a primary language)
  
What am I qualified in?
  
  ---A: I have a proficient understanding of modules, libraries and more complex things to do with the language. It is a language which I use weekly/daily and that I feel confident with.
  
  ---B: I have a good understanding of the language. I have played around with it and know how it works.
  
  ---C: I've played with this language before, but I've forgotten some stuff and don't feel as confident to use it.
 
  ---D: This is a language I am currently learning

What am I doing now?

  ---I'm taking the HarvardCS50x CS Course. I also occasionally do some challenges on Hackerrank.com, and am learning using freecodecamp, w3schools, and codecademy.
  
What do I plan to do later on?

  ---Next year I will be taking CS and Intro to Programming in school. In junior and senior years I will take AP Computer Science and Information Literacy 1 (Information Technology Capstone)
  
  ---I hope to be certified in "Scientific Computing in Python" and "Back End Development" on freecodecamp. 
  
  ---I plan to go to the Colorado School of Mines majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics.
